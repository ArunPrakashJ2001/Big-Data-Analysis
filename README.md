# Big-Data-Analysis

This project deals with the data analysis on the Crimes in Chicago dataset. This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to 2017. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. The data is approximatley 2 GB in size and has a total of 23 columns.

## The process of data analysis on the Crimes in Chicago dataset is summarized as follows:
1. Preprocessing of the dataset done in python 
3. Transformations and actions done in spark
4. Plotting of maps done in python 
5. Bar graphs and linear plots plotted in excel
